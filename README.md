# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Aaron

I'm an undergrad exploring applied ML and research in areas like speech, vision, and automation.  
Currently working on research while building and experimenting with personal projects on the side.

## ðŸ§ª Research

Some research projects I've been involved in (repos are private):

- **Current** â€“ Collaborating with PhD student at the University of Oxford on automated cell classification from microscopy images using morphometric features.

- **Past** â€“ Developed a real-time, local voice cloning system at McGill University by integrating open-source TTS models with LLMs, focusing on naturalness and low-latency performance.
